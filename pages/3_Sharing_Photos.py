            We're using a service called Wedibox to share everyone's photos from this weekend.

            - Upload your photos.
            - Download other people's photos.
            - Leave us a voice message!
            - Everything stays available for up to a year after the event.

            The wedding is officially over, and this site has been officially decommissioned, but if you really want to see some fun dancing, [click here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=nzZmaQNZXewA07WB).
