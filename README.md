This is a Streamlit site that I developed to help organize my wedding to my amazing wife in October 2025. See it at [aliandseanwedding.streamlit.app](https://aliandseanwedding.streamlit.app).

There is one fun and not-so-hard-to-find easter egg hidden in the site for those intrepid enough to find it!

All names except for my own have been changed to maintain the privacy of our guests.

This project also includes a playwright script that's run with a Github Action to keep [aliandseanwedding.streamlit.app](https://aliandseanwedding.streamlit.app) and [hypeman.streamlit.app](https://hypeman.streamlit.app) from falling asleep 💤 by opening the page and clicking the "wake up" (which worked better than my previous soultion attempt which was to automatically commit an empty change - see `auto-commit.yml`).
