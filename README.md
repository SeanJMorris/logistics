This is a Streamlit site that I developed to help organize my wedding to my amazing wife in October 2025. The site can be reached at [aliandseanwedding.streamlit.app](https://aliandseanwedding.streamlit.app).

There is one fun and not-so-hard-to-find easter egg hidden in the site for those intrepid enough to find it!

All names except for my own have been changed to maintain the privacy of our guests.

This project has an automatic blank commit scheduled to run on a regular basis with a Github Action. This prevents Streamlit - the free service used to publish this app - from putting the app to "sleep", which otherwise happens after a short period of inactivity.
