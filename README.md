This is a Streamlit site that I developed to help organize my wedding to my amazing wife in October 2025. The site can be reached at [aliandseanwedding.streamlit.app](https://aliandseanwedding.streamlit.app).

All names except for my own have been changed to maintain the privacy of our guests.

There is one fun and not-so-hard-to-find easter egg hidden in the site for those intrepid enough to find it!

This project has an automatic blank commit scheduled to run on a regular basis with a Github Action. This prevents Streamlit - the free service used to publish this app - from putting the app to "sleep", which otherwise happens after a short period of inactivity.
